# XCube
World changing XCube Programming Environment
This is the first project to create a new kind of programming language that can be easily understood. As the first goal it will be required to have a full space environment on 3D space. This space needs to be flexible and compatible with GPU graphic cards.
After having the code for it, will give the next instructions.
Cheers :)
